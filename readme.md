# 🧠 Python Deep Dive — Easy Yet Powerful 🔍

This repository is my personal effort to understand **how Python really works under the hood from basic to advance level**.

Instead of just writing code, I'm diving deep into the **core concepts** behind Python’s behavior — and explaining them in a **simple, beginner-friendly** way.
